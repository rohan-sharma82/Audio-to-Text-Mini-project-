# Audio-to-Text-Mini-project-
# **This system converts large audio files to text using a divide-and-conquer approach:**


## Process Flow:

Audio Loading → Load entire audio file into memory.


Silence Detection → Identify quiet periods (pauses) in speech.


Smart Splitting → Cut audio at silence points to create chunks.


Individual Processing → Transcribe each chunk separately using Google's API.


Text Combination → Merge all transcriptions into final result


## Dependencies


**speech_recognition** - Speech-to-text conversion using Google API


**os** - File and directory operations


**pydub** - Audio file loading and manipulation


**pydub.silence** - Splitting audio based on silence detection


## Advantages:

Higher Success Rate - Smaller chunks are easier to process.


Error Resilience - If one chunk fails, others continue processing.


Natural Boundaries - Splits at speech pauses, not mid-word.


Scalability - Can handle audio files of any length
